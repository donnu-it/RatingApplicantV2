Whoever\n\t * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\n\t * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\n\t * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\n\t * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\n\t * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n\t * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n\t * they only require implementing two methods.\n\t *\n\t * <pre>\n\t *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n\t *                                      +        +\n\t *                                      |        |\n\t *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n\t *                    |                 v        |              |\n\t *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n\t *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n\t *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n\t *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n\t *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n\t *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n\t *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n\t *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n\t * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n\t * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n\t *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n\t *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n\t *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n\t * </pre>\n\t *\n\t * Use cases:\n\t * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n\t *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n\t * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n\t *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n\t * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n\t *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n\t * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n\t *   content.\n\t * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n\t *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n\t * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n\t *\n\t * Transactional plugin API:\n\t * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n\t * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n\t *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n\t * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n\t * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n\t *\n\t * @class Transaction\n\t */\n\tvar TransactionImpl = {\n\t  /**\n\t   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.
